# Database Seeding

This directory contains seed data and scripts for populating the database with sample data for development and testing.

## Files

- `seed-data.interface.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for seed data
- `users.seed.ts` - Sample user data
- `posts.seed.ts` - Sample blog post data
- `seed-runner.ts` - Main seeding logic
- `seed.ts` - Entry point for the seed script
- `index.ts` - Exports for the seeding module

## Usage

### Development (with ts-node)
```bash
npm run seed
```

### Production (compiled)
```bash
npm run seed:dev
```

## Sample Data

### Users
The seed data includes 6 sample users:
- `john_doe` / `password123`
- `jane_smith` / `password123`
- `alex_dev` / `password123`
- `sarah_coder` / `password123`
- `mike_tech` / `password123`
- `demo_user` / `demo123`

### Posts
The seed data includes 9 sample blog posts covering various topics:
- TypeScript fundamentals
- NestJS API development
- React Hooks
- CSS Grid vs Flexbox
- Docker for developers
- GraphQL introduction
- Modern JavaScript features
- Database design best practices

## Features

- **Automatic password hashing** - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- **Data verification** - The seed runner verifies that data was created successfully
- **Clean seeding** - Existing data is cleared before seeding new data
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Relationship mapping** - Posts are properly linked to their authors

## Customization

To add more seed data:

1. Add new users to `users.seed.ts`
2. Add new posts to `posts.seed.ts` (make sure the `authorUsername` matches an existing user)
3. Run the seed script

## Notes

- The seed script will clear all existing data before seeding
- Passwords are automatically hashed by the User entity's `@BeforeInsert` hook
- The script includes verification to ensure data was created successfully
- All timestamps are automatically generated by TypeORM
